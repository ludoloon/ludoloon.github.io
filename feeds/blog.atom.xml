More to come!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently decided to pursue my passion for music more seriously. If you don't know already, &lt;a href="http://putz.space"&gt;I've been putting up music for almost a decade now as Groove Masta Putz.&lt;/a&gt; Originally I was going to just put up video game music under the same name, but I decided that there are different audiences I'm approaching for these projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This side of my music projects will be focused on music for video game studios as a composer. I will leave Groove Masta Putz as a Solo project dedicated to the people who have been following my music there. It will be more personal and less tailored to business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it! Keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="music"></category></entry></feed>
