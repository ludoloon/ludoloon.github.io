&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music for all types of classic RPG &amp;amp; Action Adventure locations! Ready to go, easy to customize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roguelike Adventure Music Pack&lt;/i&gt; is the essential music pack for any game that needs high quality, memorable tunes that are &lt;b&gt;ready to go for your game, right now.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each track has a variety of &lt;b&gt;full length, seamlessly loopable&lt;/b&gt; versions and sections. You can craft the emotion &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; how you need it based on your narrative or game mechanic needs. If you prefer to do it the old fashioned way and just set it on loop, as is, you can also do that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included are a variety of classic video game &lt;b&gt;themed locations&lt;/b&gt; such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Castle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dungeon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hills &amp;amp; Valleys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sewers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Winter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pack also includes other essential game sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Victory music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game Over music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loot SFX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasure SFX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've decided to release this track as my last addition to the &lt;a href="https://ludoloon.studio/blog/flight-sim-portraits/"&gt;Flight Sim Portraits&lt;/a&gt; project that I had going on. This isn't a definitive end to the project forever, but in light of my goals I've decide that this has served its purpose for now. I do like making these videos, so maybe one day I'll come back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has been a great way to get routine practice putting out weekly content, but video production &amp;amp; recording takes up too much time compared to actual music production right now. My next goal is to start making game packs to upload on itch.io and the Unity Asset Store, which is already well under way. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/1399009?border_width=0&amp;amp;bg_color=333&amp;amp;fg_color=EEE&amp;amp;link_color=00abde&amp;amp;border_color=4e4e4e" width="550" height="165" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ludoloonstudio.itch.io/mysterious-fog"&gt;Mysterious Fog (Royalty Free Music Track) by LudoLoon Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/mysterious-fog-royalty-free-213501"&gt;Download on the Unity Asset Store as well.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What better way than by recording a game I'm already sinking hundreds of hours into!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLL06MmY4OQnZJtHTVJ4IlCetgx6wgS_b6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've recently shifted my focus to working on my music more seriously. My goal is to start producing custom music for video games (and beyond), but at the moment I don't have much to show off for LudoLoon Studio since it's a new project. So to build up a little portfolio, and more importantly skill, I've decided to start making music to scenes I record from playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those unaware, Flight Sim 2020 is basically the most photorealistic flight simulator released to date. Literally the whole world is available to explore via satellite imagery, AI generated buildings, trees, etc. If you think it's immersive on a screen, try VR! lol. It's pretty epic to say the least. Most importantly, I already play it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, it doesn't actually have any music outside of some select discovery flight locations and menus. So it's a pretty good way to explore adding music to suit a visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine the fact that I like the game, need some practice "vibe matching", and just need to make more music in general to get in the groove of becoming a regular producer again, that's why I'm putting together these videos. &lt;/p&gt;
